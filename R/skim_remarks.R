()\n-CI: confidence interval (lower, upper = 95cat('\u25')); computed via t.test; interpretation: if data acquisition will be repeated 100 times 95cat('\u25') of the mean values should fall within CI.\n\ngeneral remarks for interpretation:\n\n- overlapping CI or sem between samples = not signif. different BUT: non-overlapping does NOT INDICATE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.\n- correct declaration of mean value e.g. ([M]; 1,35; 95 cat('\u25') CI; 1,23 â€“ 1,56)\n\n")
